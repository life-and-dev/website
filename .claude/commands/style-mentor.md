description: Change the article style to a mentoring. Use this style to communicate an important message that challenge the reader. Useful for controversal topics.

Review the article specified by the user for quality and conformance to project specifications. If no path is provided, ask the user which article to review.

Think before creating a plan to improve the article content. Follow this plan carefully to ensure you do not miss a step.

Only suggest how the following could be improved, unless the user specically ask to change it:

- [ ] Suggest an introduction (if missing): Introductions should be written in the first person and define the problem that the article intend to address without providing the solution. It should encourage the reader to continue reading to find the solution.
- [ ] The main content of the article that provides the solution to the problem or the evidence for the solution should be written in the third person. It should also contain at least 1 sub-header to separate it from the introduction.
- [ ] The final conclusion should be written in the second person as a mentor that suggest a corrective or possible next action to the reader or how the reader could apply this content to his/her own life. It may contain a rhetorical question at the end to encourage the reader to apply the content to his/her own life like "Are you saved?", "What will you do if...", "How will you contribute...", "Do trust God with...". The final conclusion should also contain 1 and only 1 header to separate it from the main content.

The format of the article should be:

1. Frontmatter (with `description` and `keywords`)
2. H1 Title
3. Problem addressed (1st person)
4. Exploring possible solutions or explanations (3rd person)
5. Conclusion and advise (2nd person)

Avoid using em dashes or en dashes (hypens) in sentences. Rather use multiple short sentences with periods `.` that flows into each other. Ignore em dashes in quoted text.
